# Rust Advent of Code 2022
My attempt at Advent of Code 2022 using Rust.

Layout of the project should put any test inputs under `input/` as e.g. `01.txt` for Day 1.

The code for each day can be placed under `src/bin/` as e.g. `01.rs` for each day, with a `main()` which runs any necessary parts.

Common code should be able to be shared between these binaries.

To run, specify the day like `cargo run --bin 01`, or set the `Cargo.toml` default (usually set to most up-to-date day). Same goes for any tests.
